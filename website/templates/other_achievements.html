        <p>A CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, 
            is a type of artificial intelligence. It is mainly used for analyzing images. 
            It works by breaking the image into small pieces and looking for patterns. 
            These patterns help it recognize things in the image, like edges or shapes.

            For some of my CNN projects, I have created some models for binary classification or image classification: 
            including classifying between cats and dogs, MNIST (hand-written digits) or applying in the medical fields to detect malaria diseases.

        <h1>IELTS certificate</h1>
        <p>
            I wanna tell you my journey of studying English, IELTS preparation and also a true story of me joining in the IELTS examination, all the problems I encountered a long the way and how I managed to get through.
            So First of all, my journey to IELTS started in 2022 but initially I wasn't really interested in studying and I was just thinking to myself that I wouldn't need English for my later work.
            However, when I promised to myself to learn seriously, I gradually developed a passion for English. I felt excited about all the expressions that I didn't know before, about the other countries' cultures. 
            And over the time, I felt pretty comfortable with the English environment around me, I can understand much more when I listened to broadcast and news.
            Here are some recommended sources that can help you improve your English in generally, not just about IELTS:

            I still remembered vividly it was On April 20th, 2024, and before that day, I got super sick, I had been sneezing and coughing a lot for many days before the day.
            The stress is also on my shoulder when I had to review quickly everything I had learned, with the sheer amount of knowledge making me feel so overwhelmed.
            And just a few hours before the exam, I got some sleep deprivation, only 1 hour of sleeping that made me feel like I cannot think anything straight.
