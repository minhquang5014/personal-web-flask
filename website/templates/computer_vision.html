        <h1>Facial recognition</h1>
        <p>
            Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual's identity using their face. 
            Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time.
            To achieve this, it's important that the deep learning model can extract a 128-dimensional feature vector from the face image. 
            After obtaining the encodings of the face, it compares with the encodings of known faces, and then compares the "face distance".
            If the distance between the new face encoding and a known face encoding is below a certain threshold, the faces are considered a match.

            I find it pretty inresting to work with some frameworks like mediapipe (because of their fast speed in face detection) and 
            face_cognition (for their efficient face distinguishing between individuals). Some projects I have made are face recognition for attendence projects,
            intergrating face detection in taking photos and recording videos for training my ML models, face filtering, head-pose estimation, etc

        <h1>Depth estimation</h1>
        <p>
            For depth estimation, the MiDaS model v2.1 is lightweight and running pretty smoothly on my computer. 
            Some tasks like estimating depth for head-pose detection run super fast, and i am excited about it. 
            However, due to some limitations in terms of equipments, I would not recommend monocular depth estimation as it is not as accurate and efficient as
            stereo vision. If you have two stereo camera, it would provide you with the accurate estimation, and it's recommended for some projects
            like building vision for robots or flycam.
